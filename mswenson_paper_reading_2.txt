ORB-SLAM: A Versatile and Accurate Monocular SLAM System 
ORB-SLAM is a feature-based monocular SLAM algorithm that runs in real time indoor or outdoors. Some of its main
differentiating features are that is uses ORB (Oriented FAST  and rotated BRIEF) feature detection, and that it
uses the same features for mapping, tracking, place recognition and loop closure. 
The system uses independent tracking, local mapping, and loop closure threads for faster computation. Features
gathered from relevant keyframes are aggressively culled, keeping only high quality features. A bag of words 
approach is used for place recognition. In general ORB-SLAM seems to combine most groundbreaking SLAM methods
from the pre-2015 period. 


LSD-SLAM: Large-Scale Direct Monocular SLAM
This paper proposes a featureless, monocular SLAM algorithm that builds large, consistent maps. 
It includes more information than feature-based SLAM algorithms by performing direct image frame alignment, 
using an estimation of the camera pose from the last tracked frame. This is done based using an error function that
incorporates photometric error and residual variance, allowing for direct depth estimation. Frames sufficiently distant from previous
keyframes are made into new keyframes, intermediary frames are used to refine the depth map estimation. Map optimization
occurs in the background using pose-graph optimization.
